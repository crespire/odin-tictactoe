Additions
This script was a test bed for TDD, and RSpec, so the code has been refactored slightly since it was originally finished. As much as I originally wanted to refactor to be more OO oriented, I think it makes sense to complete the tests
and move on in the curriculum.

# TODO
This was the first big thing I wrote in Ruby, so it was basically a procedural script wrapped in a class. With that in mind:
* Consider refactoring this program a little bit more to utilize more OO design principles.
